# FaRBIE
Linked Data brings countless RDF Knowledge Graphs to the Web. Faceted Browsing is a popular type of User Interface (UI) for average users to explore the knowledge in RDF Graphs. Due to the distributed and semi-structured nature of RDF Graphs, exploring more than one graph at a time is a common scenario in the LOD cloud. Exploring multiple RDF graphs adds a degree of uncertainty to the user interface, e.g. connectivity problems and longer query execution times, only aggravated by the variations in the size of the retrieved data, and the complexity in the semantics of the data. We present FaRBIE a reactive faceted browsing to explore multiple RDF Knowledge Graphs simultaneously. 

The reactive approach implemented in FaRBIE allows the interface to react adequately to the uncertainty imposed by the intrinsic nature of RDF Graphs, thus enhancing the user experience. FaRBIE is composed of reactive User Interface components, refined from common Faceted Browsing UIs, and improved by means of reactive design patterns.
